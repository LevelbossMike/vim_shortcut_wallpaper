A vim cheat sheet wallpaper based on a wallpaper by [Ted Naleid](http://naleid.com/blog/2010/10/04/vim-movement-shortcuts-wallpaper/). Colors are based on [solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) which makes looking at it even more aaaawesome.

If you are using MacVim I suggest you set your background transparent and you will be able to see the cheat sheet
while editing. Set it something between 10-20 percent and you
should be fine. For example:

    :set transparency=15

This wallpaper should 'work' with both the dark and the light theme of [solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized). OmniGraffle files are included if you feel like customizing this to your own vim colorscheme. 

Thanks to [@EspadaV8](https://github.com/Espadav8 "@EspadaV8") there's a dark version of this wallpaper now as well.

There is also a version with a 'real' background based on tremblingpixels'
[breathe](http://browse.deviantart.com/customization/wallpaper/?q=breathe#/d4cae4w) wallpaper now:

We also have a version that preserves the gradient of the original, but changes the color to a nice soothing blue:
