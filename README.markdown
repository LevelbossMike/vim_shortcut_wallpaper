A vim cheat sheet wallpaper based on a wallpaper by [Ted Naleid](https://www.naleid.com/2010/10/04/vim-movement-shortcuts-wallpaper.html). Colors are based on [solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) which makes looking at it even more aaaawesome.

If you are using MacVim or a terminal that supports transparency (e.g. Iterm) I suggest you set your background transparent and you will be able to see the cheat sheet
while editing. Set it something between 10-20 percent and you
should be fine. For example in MacVim:

    :set transparency=15

OmniGraffle files are included if you feel like customizing this to your own vim colorscheme. 

Thanks to [@EspadaV8](https://github.com/Espadav8 "@EspadaV8") there's a dark version of this wallpaper now as well.

There is also a version with a 'real' background based on tremblingpixels'

We also have a version that preserves the gradient of the original, but changes the color to a nice soothing blue:
